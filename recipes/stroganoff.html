    <p>I created this beef stroganoff recipe with hamburger because I love the taste of a <br>
       good stroganoff, but I don't like the expense of beef tips, steak, or roast beef, nor <br>
        do I like all the time it takes to make them. My version is creamy and tastes great.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into pieces</li>
    <li>1 (6 ounce) can chopped mushrooms, with liquid</li>
    <li>1 (.75 ounce) packet dry brown gravy mix</li>
    <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
    <li>Â½ cup milk</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions to prepare a stroganoff</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, cook ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring <br>
        occasionally, until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard <br>
        grease. Stir in cream cheese, mushrooms with liquid, and gravy mix; cook and <br>
        stir over medium heat until cream cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Add condensed <br>
        soup, sour cream, and milk; cook, stirring occasionally, until smooth and creamy, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drain egg noodles; stir into the beef mixture. Cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
